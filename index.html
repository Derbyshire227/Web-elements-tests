A short walk away you will find the Bon Accord & St Nicholas Shopping Centre, home to a wide range of fashion, gift and homeware retailers. Union Square, Trinity Shopping Centre and Academy Shopping Centre shopping centres are also close by.
For independent retailers, head to the West End and the Rosemount areas where quaint streets are lined with fashion boutiques, vintage shops, purveyors of traditional crafts and delicacies, along with cafes and eateries to suit all tastes and budgets. </p>

<p hidden id="eatingOut"> As a globally important business hub and centre of learning, Aberdeen is home to a diverse population, which is reflected in its cuisine. From fine city centre restaurants to traditional pubs serving locally sourced produce, you can be sure of a true taste of the <a href="https://visitabdn.com/food-and-drink" target="_blank" class="ltc-cyan">Granite City</a>.
Its location means eating out in Aberdeen is an unforgettable experience. With the freshest seafood, world renowned locally reared meats, and a bewildering range of cuisines from across the world, Aberdeen will astound with amazing food for all budgets.</p> 

<p hidden id="nightLife">From a big night out to a quiet drink with friends, Aberdeen’s nightlife has it covered. Across the city you can find pubs, swanky cocktail bars, and nightclubs for all tastes. 
Enjoy a traditionally brewed craft beer at one of the many pubs and taverns, including the world famous <a href=" https://www.brewdog.com/bars/uk/aberdeen" class="ltc-cyan">Brewdog Bar</a>, and no trip to Aberdeen would be complete without sampling one of over 600 whiskies at <a href=" http://thegrillaberdeen.co.uk" target="_blank" class="ltc-cyan">The Grill.</a> Aberdeen has eight nightclubs with themes from 80s and 90s music to dance and soul, or for a different vibe, go underground at <a href=" https://visitabdn.com/listing/the-tunnels" target="_blank" class="ltc-cyan">The Tunnels</a> under Union Street, where chart topping singer Emeli Sande performed before hitting the big time. </p>

<p hidden id="culture">Thousands of years of history is reflected in the fascinating range of exhibits on view at Aberdeen’s many museums, including the <a href=" http://www.visitabdn.com/attractions-and-activities/view/aberdeen-maritime-museum" target="_blank" class="ltc-cyan">Aberdeen Maritime Museum,</a> <a href=" http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/tourism_visitor_attractions/galleries_museums/art_Tolbooth.asp" target="_blank" class="ltc-cyan">Tolbooth Museum,</a> <a href=" https://www.abdn.ac.uk/sbs/outreach/zoology-museum.php" target="_blank" class="ltc-cyan">Zoology Museum</a>, and the <a href=" http://www.visitabdn.com/attractions-and-activities/view/aberdeen-art-gallery" target="_blank" class="ltc-cyan">Aberdeen Art Gallery</a>.

A must-see among the many memorable buildings shining across the city is <a href=" http://www.visitabdn.com/attractions-and-activities/view/marischal-college" target="_blank" class="ltc-cyan">Marischal College,</a> the second largest granite building in the world - only Escorial in Spain is larger. 
A short distance from the city lies Royal Deeside with <a href="http://www.balmoralcastle.com" target="_blank" class="ltc-cyan">Balmoral Castle</a> at its heart, and home to some of the best outdoor activities in Europe. The mountains and rugged terrain of the <a href="http://cairngorms.co.uk" target="_blank" class="ltc-cyan">Cairngorms National Park</a> also provide a spectacular backdrop for outdoor adventures. Alternatively, head for the Aberdeenshire and <a href="http://www.banffshirecoast.com" target="_blank" class="ltc-cyan">Banffshire Coast,</a> described by National Geographic as one of the world’s outstanding coastlines, where you will find quiet beaches under towering cliffs. </p>
